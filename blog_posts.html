                            <ul>
                            <li class="blogentry">Today we learned <code>HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language</code> in  web design. It was kind of overwhelming with all the new tags we were learning (like <code>&ltol&gt, &lth1&gt, and &ltbutton&gt</code>), but it was fun to feel like a hacker, editing all this code.</li>


                            <li class="blogentry">In Graphics Design, we learned about all the different types of tools that you can use to edit images. We also learned about typefaces and font families, which we enjoyed. Although it was kind of difficult to understand which fonts were serif and which were sans serif, we were eventually able to grasp the concepts.</li>

                            <li class="blogentry">We also learned python, and by the end of class, we knew all the different data types in python.</li>

                            <li class="blogentry"> Finally, we covered business, the core of this camp. We went over what a startup is, and how to make one. At the end, we touched on what we had to do, and I must say, it looked <u>really</u> overwhelming. But all in all, this camp was starting to look like a lot of fun!</li>

                            <h3> Tutorial: How To Make A Basic Website</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>To start off your website, you first need a<code>&lthtml&gt</code> tag. This is a basic tag that is the first line of every single html page. At the bottom of the page, close the tag by putting<code>&lt/html&gt</code>, so the computer knows the page is done. This is also how all tags are closed in html: put a / before restating the tag name.</li>
                                <br>G
                                <li>Second, you need a <code>&lthead&gt</code> tag. This includes all the main elements taht go at the top of the page, such as <code>&ltstyle&gt</code> and <code>&ltmeta&gt</code>.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>Third, you need a <code>&lttitle&gt</code> tag. This actually isn't necessary, but if you want your tab text changed, this is the tag for you. It will go inside the <code>&lthead&gt</code> tag, as it's one of the main elements at the top of an html page.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>Next comes the <code>&ltbody&gt</code> tag, the heart and soul of html. This is where all of your other tags will go, like your <code>&lth1&gt</code> tag.</li><br>
                                <li>After that, you basically have your code down. Now, you need some style. you can use <code>style=""</code> to reference CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets. Inside the quotes, you can put <code>font-family</code>, which then takes in a font name, such as "times new roman".</li>
                                <br>
                                <li> After fonts, you need color.<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp"> w3schools.com</a> has a great color picker that you can choose background and text colors from.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li> Now, you can add some images! This is done using the <code>&ltimg src=""&gt tag&gt</code>. Inside the quotes, you put the url of the picture that you found. After the the starting tag, put the link text that you want to show on the page.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>You'll probably want to check your code now, just to make sure that you haven't skipped closing any tags or misspelled any text.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>Run the html code you've just made by right-clicking on the code, and selecting "Open in Browser".</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>Congratulations! You've made a basic html page. But the fun doesn't end here. You can experiment with other tags in the future, but these are the basics.</li>
                            </ol>

                       <ul>
                            <li class="blogentry">Today, we learned how the internet works. You send your search request to the Domain Name Service (DNS), and then the DNS sends you the website's IP address. </li>

                            <li class="blogentry">In addition to learning how the internet works, we learned what saturation and value is in graphic design. </li>

                            <li class="blogentry">We learned what the different types of businesses are, and how to make money from them.</li>

                            <li class="blogentry">We had relay races in Python to see who was able to solve a problem first. It was difficult at first, but we really enjoyed it after we got a hang of it.</li>

                        <ol>
                        	<li> When you first start Graphic Design Photoshop CS6, you need to hit control N and make the size of the image you want.</li>
                            <li> When you want to type something, you should use a clear font like sans serif, not cursive.</li>
                            <li> Primary Colors will look good if you want to put it in the background.</li>
                         <li>The people who are looking at your website or magazine only look at it for about 3 seconds so you should make it look good.</li>
                         <li> Dont make the cover page too colorful because it wont look good or fit in whatever you are doing. </li>
                        <li> When you are putting a description of anything, the font has to be readable</li>
                        <li>Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and black are the standard colour modes for sending documents. </li>
                        <li> All the images have to fit with the font colors and the type of font.</li>
                        <li>Use contrast yo capture your readers attention. </li>
                        <li> Make sure you know what value saturation is. </li>
